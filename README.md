# ðŸ“• Nuxt Layers + DDD

**Demonstration of using Nuxt Layers to achieve a domain-driven architecture.**

## Introduction

This project is a practical example of implementing a domain-driven architecture in a Nuxt.js application. By leveraging Nuxt Layers and
modules, it demonstrates one way of organizing a large-scale application in a way that is one step closer to align with domain-driven design
principles. This approach aims to simplify development and maintenance by structurally separating different concerns and functionalities of
the application.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of concerns aligning with business domains.
- **Modular Architecture**: Using Nuxt modules and layers to encapsulate domain logic.

## How it works

### Root configuration

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    './domain/blog',
  ],
  blog: {
    //
  }
})
```

The `extends` property is utilized to extend the configuration from the domain/blog directory. This means that settings defined in the blog
domain's nuxt.config.ts are incorporated into the root configuration.

The `blog` object is a placeholder for any blog-specific options that might be needed. These options' interface is defined in
the `nuxt.module.ts` file in the `domain/blog` directory.

### Domain Specific Configuration

The `nuxt.config.ts` within the `domain/blog` directory is structured to define the modules and configurations specific to the blog domain.

```typescript
const currentDir = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    join(currentDir, './nuxt.module.ts'),
  ],
})
```

The modules array includes './nuxt.module.ts'. This is where the specific modules for the blog domain are defined. These could include APIs,
external components, or other functionalities specific to the blog part of the application.

## Modular and Extensible Architecture

The overall architecture is modular and extensible. By structuring the application in this way, each domain (like the blog) can have its own
configuration and modules, isolated from other parts of the application. This makes the application more maintainable and scalable, as each
domain can be developed and modified independently.

## Conclusion

This setup illustrates a powerful way to structure a Nuxt.js application, particularly for large-scale projects where separating concerns by
domain is beneficial. It enhances the maintainability, scalability, and organization of the codebase, aligning with domain-driven design
principles.
